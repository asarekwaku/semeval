The ending talks about clearing his name and getting justice, which doesn't provide any context for the word \"suits\".\n4. However, the phrase \"he had many\" implies that John has accumulated something over time, which is consistent with the proposed meaning of garments.\n\nScore: 2.8\n\nI gave it a score of 2.8 because while the sentence is ambiguous and doesn't provide strong evidence for or against the proposed meaning, the context doesn't strongly suggest an alternative meaning either. The phrase \"he had many\" does hint at the possibility that John has accumulated garments, but it's not a clear or compelling connection."}
